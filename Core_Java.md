Object Oriented Concepts
------------------------------------
Abstraction: In Java, abstraction is hiding certain details and showing essential features of the object. It lets users to focus on capabilities of the object, not on how it does. 
Encapsulation: This deals with the state of the object. Objects encapsulate their state and users of object can access through functions or methods. Example is classes having variables with private modifiers and expose their state using getter and setter.
Inheritance: Java allows classes to inherit state and behavior from other classes. Each class is allowed to have only one superclass and each superclass can have unlimited subclasses.
Polymorphism: expressing in different forms or behaviors. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors by overriding the method with their own implementation.
Class: blueprint or prototype of object which defines its state and behavior.
Interface: It is a contract where anybody implementing an interface needs to provide the behavior.
