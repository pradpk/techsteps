- org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface represents the Spring IoC container. This container instantiates, configures, and assemble beans by using externally provided configuration metadata. Configuration metadata (bean definitions) represents how application developer tell Spring Container to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects in your application.
- "Control of the managing bean and it's lifecycle" is part of the container and not the programmers, which is why it is named the "Inversion of Control."
- Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and is the act of connecting objects with other objects, or "injecting" objects into other objects. Dependency injections are performed by an assembler rather than by the objects themselves. There are two types of DI : Constructor Injection and Setter Injection.
- Difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Controller: @Component represents Spring bean (just like we declare Spring beans in xml files). Other annotations @Service, @Repository and @Controller are specific versions of @Component. @Controller are supposed to be declared in a controller class and DispatcherServlet will look for @RequestMapping objects to automatically map it with the controller. @Service annotation is for beans in service layer and @Repository annotation is for beans in persistence layer.
