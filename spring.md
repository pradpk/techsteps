- org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface represents the Spring IoC container. This container instantiates, configures, and assemble beans by using externally provided configuration metadata. Configuration metadata (bean definitions) represents how application developer tell Spring Container to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects in your application.
- "Control of the managing bean and it's lifecycle" is part of the container and not the programmers, which is why it is named the "Inversion of Control."
- Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and is the act of connecting objects with other objects, or "injecting" objects into other objects. Dependency injections are performed by an assembler rather than by the objects themselves. There are two types of DI : Constructor Injection and Setter Injection.
