- GraalVM offers a comprehensive platform in which an application can be developed with multiple programming languages including java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, R, C/C++.
- Java applications will run faster in GraalVM than JVM (terms and conditions apply) which will be benefical in addition to providing extensibility via scripting languages.
- To take advantage of GraalVM, we can create native images from JVM based applications and run the image (ahead of time compilling). This will reduce the startup costs. Example to build native image : https://www.graalvm.org/docs/examples/native-list-dir/
