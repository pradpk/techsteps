Microservices is an architechtural approach to develop applications which is by decomposing business domain models into services. These services are (supposed to be) small, autonomous and isolated, but provide a complete business functionality when they work together.

Advantages
- Freedom to develop and deploy independently.
- Services can be developed independently in any language.
- Easy implementation of continuous delivery.
- Easy to scale and re-use.
- Easy for containerization.
- Complement for cloud activities.
- Security issue is isolated as the applications are deployed on different servers.
